  "summary": "The diff implements most of the core requirements including splash screen, home with trending carousel, category sections, AI recommendations, continue watching, search with suggestions, watchlist functionality, kids mode, user authentication (Internet Identity), profile management, navigation, and dark cinematic UI. However, several key requirements are missing or incomplete, and there are no obvious hallucinated features beyond the specification.",
